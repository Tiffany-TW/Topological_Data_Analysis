# Topology and Data
## Carlsson 2009
### Section 1. Introduction
#### Study Notes
* The mathematical formalism which has been developed for incorporating geometric and topological techniques deals with point clouds, ie. finite sets of points equipped with a distance function.
#### Takeaways
The author attempted to approach big data from a topological perspective. Due to the ever-changing nature of data, high-dimensional and noisy data present more frequently than ever. In his opinion, methods inspired by topology can complement the limitations of geometric approaches. The followings are limitations for geometric methods and advantages of topological methods:

* **Metrics are not theoretically justified**
For most geometric approaches, such as t-SNE and maniflod learning, it is necessary that the metric to use is clear and rigorous. In other words, the distance function shall satisfy the mathematical conditions. However, this is a strict assumption. In biology, the notion of distance or metric is rather ambiguous. For example, having the measurement of similarity between DNA sequences to be defined as "distance" is intuitive for biologists. However, it does not define a theoretically correct "metric". Interestingly, the geometric properties studied by topology is less sensitive to the choice of metric
